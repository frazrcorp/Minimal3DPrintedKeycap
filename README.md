# Minimal3DPrintedKeycap

### This is a keycap model with the following goals:
- 3D-printable
- requires as little plastic as possible
- doesn't require cleaning 
- uses as little height as possible
- uses as much width as possible

This is the result. I hope it is useful to you. 

I also have a few recommended print settings, [shown here](recommendedsettings/recommendedsettings.md)
